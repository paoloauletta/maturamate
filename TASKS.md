# MaturaMate Performance Optimization Plan

## 1. Component Structure Optimization

- [x] Convert data fetching logic to Server Components (-server.tsx)
- [x] Move static UI elements to Server Components
- [x] Limit Client Components to interactive elements only
- [x] Review all components in /app/components/ for proper client/server separation

## 2. Data Fetching & Loading States

- [x] Implement React.Suspense for data loading boundaries
- [x] Create standardized loading components for different sections
- [x] Move API calls to Server Components where possible
- [ ] Use streaming for large data sets

## 3. Dynamic Imports

- [x] Identify non-critical UI components for dynamic loading
- [x] Convert modals, dialogs, and complex UI elements to use dynamic imports
- [x] Use next/dynamic with { ssr: false } for client-only components
- [ ] Lazy load third-party libraries

## 4. Image Optimization

- [ ] Replace all <img> tags with Next.js <Image> component
- [ ] Set explicit width and height on all images
- [ ] Configure proper image formats (WebP/AVIF)
- [ ] Set priority for above-the-fold images

## 5. Code Splitting & Prefetching

- [x] Ensure all navigation uses <Link> component
- [ ] Review and optimize bundle sizes using build analytics
- [x] Split large components into smaller, focused ones
- [x] Implement proper route-based code splitting

## 6. Caching & Static Optimization

- [ ] Implement ISR for semi-static data
- [ ] Add appropriate cache headers for API responses
- [ ] Use SWR or React Query for client-side data fetching with caching
- [ ] Optimize database queries

## 7. Network Request Optimization

- [x] Audit all network requests using DevTools
- [x] Eliminate redundant API calls
- [x] Combine multiple API calls where possible
- [ ] Implement proper error handling to prevent cascading failures

## 8. Implementation Approach

1. [x] Start with the dashboard page (current load time: 4.51s)
2. [x] Identify bottlenecks using performance profiling
3. [x] Apply server/client component separation
4. [x] Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
5. [x] Optimize images and add Suspense boundaries
6. [ ] Measure improvements and iterate

## 9. Prioritized Tasks

### High Priority (Implemented)

1. ✅ Convert dashboard data fetching to server components
2. ✅ Implement Suspense boundaries around data-dependent UI
3. ✅ Dynamically import heavy UI components like sidebar
4. ✅ Create dedicated client and server components with proper boundaries
5. ✅ Apply the same optimization patterns to the statistics page
6. ✅ Apply the same optimization patterns to the exercises page and topic routes

### Medium Priority (Next Steps)

1. [ ] Optimize images using the Next.js Image component
2. [ ] Implement proper caching strategies
3. [ ] Optimize database queries by caching results

### Low Priority (Future Work)

1. [ ] Fine-tune prefetching strategies
2. [ ] Optimize third-party script loading
3. [ ] Implement advanced caching patterns
